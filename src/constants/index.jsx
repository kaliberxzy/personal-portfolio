            Hi, I’m Colin! I’m about to graduate from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, IL,
            with a degree in computer engineering, a minor in computer science, and a specialization
            in cyber systems and security engineering. But that doesn’t
            <span class="italic font-bold bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 from-30% to-[#FF0000] bg-clip-text text-transparent"> really </span>
            capture who I am.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m a learner, designer, problem-solver, and adventurer who puts in the hard work to make it count.
            I love building with LEGO, listening to music that makes me go “ooOOoo,” and riding my electric
            skateboard to the gym after classes. Over the past four years (and even in high school), 
            I’ve pushed myself to be the best version of who I can be. I don’t just love making things—I
            love making things I’m proud of. Whether it’s a personal portfolio website like this one or
            the senior design project my team and I have worked on this past year,  
            <span class="italic font-bold bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 from-30% to-[#FF0000] bg-clip-text text-transparent"> I always give 100%.</span>

            That effort hasn’t gone unnoticed. I was recently awarded the Dean Kenneth E. Tempelmeyer 
            <span class="italic font-bold bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 from-30% to-[#FF0000] bg-clip-text text-transparent">  Outstanding Senior Award </span>
             in the College of Engineering, and last year, I received the Dr. Glafkos Galanos Memorial Scholarship for high academic achievement. 
            Pair that drive for excellence with a love of learning and curiosity, and you get a big part of who I am. 
            I enjoy diving into new topics and often find myself going down rabbit holes—whether it’s comic book lore or something unexpected, like roller coasters.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also love building and designing things. At Stifel, I applied this ability to build a metric
            dashboard using React and TailwindCSS, along with a SharePoint site that serves as an internal
            learning platform. For my senior design project, we created a wirelessly controlled, bicycle-towed
            weed eater to help clear weeds on hiking and biking trails. 
            I was responsible for implementing the wireless control system, and I loved designing every aspect
            of it—from the logic control states and the microcontroller’s UI to 3D modeling a cam-and-follower
            mechanism in TinkerCAD. And that was the last thing I’ve built ...
            <span class="italic font-bold bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 from-30% to-[#FF0000] bg-clip-text text-transparent"> for now.</span>

export const INTEREST_TEXT_UI = `My passion for web design began during my second internship at Stifel, where I
                                learned React JS and TailwindCSS to build a metric dashboard.
                                I’ve always loved designing things that look cool—whether it’s simple logos
                                for friends and family, posters for my RA bulletin boards, PowerPoint presentations, or even LEGO builds.`;

export const INTEREST_TEXT_HARDWARE = `I love building things and figuring out how they work, especially computers. 
                                    What started with assembling gaming PCs for friends led me
                                    to major in computer engineering. Some of my favorite courses explored system architecture,
                                    assembly language, and how memory works at a low level.`;

export const INTEREST_TEXT_SECURITY = `At SIU, I specialized in cybersecurity  after realizing how often solutions
                                    are designed without security in mind. Within weeks of my first cybersecurity class,
                                    I became deeply interested in the field and began exploring (and presenting) various subtopics,
                                    including blockchain, web application security, and Bluetooth vulnerabilities.`;

export const INTEREST_TEXT_SOFTWARE = `Learning to code and building projects using software has been one of the most
                                    fulfilling experiences of my college career. From machine learning in Python to
                                    microcontroller development in C, programming has proven to be a rewarding skill
                                    and one I’m constantly working to improve.`;

export const WORK_TEXT_1 = `During my second summer with Stifel, I collaborated with a scrum team of interns and developers to build an internal web application that visualized
                            live metric data of the department’s 15+ agile teams. Using React, JS, Tailwind, TremorUI, and Figma, I spearheaded
                            client-side development of the project, whose backend fetched and analyzed over 200,000 Jira issues via REST APIs. 
                            During the site's development, I actively met with stakeholders to gather feedback for the user interface and desired functionality.`;

export const WORK_TEXT_2 = `During my first summer with Stifel, I helped enhance intracompany understanding of 8–10 technical processes by developing
                            detailed workflow documents for Stifel’s two flagship products, showcasing strong analytical skills in data collection
                            and organization with a strong attention to detail. I also shadowed a 14–15 member scrum DevOps team in an agile environment,
                            gaining proficiency in software development life cycle, Jira project management, and Microsoft Azure. This enabled me to 
                            experience and participate in sprint planning, backlog refinement, and daily stand-ups.`;

export const WORK_TEXT_3 = `At SalukiTech, SIU's IT support department, I mentored a team of around 6–20 student employees,
                            fostering their technical skill development (and mine) in IT troubleshooting and device deployment.
                            As a technician, I used an ITSM ticketing system to manage, monitor, and document 300+ devices and IT projects.
                            For troubleshooting, I leveraged my Apple and Dell hardware certifications to diagnose and resolve software and hardware issues.
                            I also led improvements in operating procedures, enhancing workflow efficiency and reducing deployment time for 800+ faculty members.`;
